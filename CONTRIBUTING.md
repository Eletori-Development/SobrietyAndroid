# Contributing

Thank you for thinking about contributing to Lotus, we really appreciate it! We have a few ways that you can help us.
In this document, we will tell you the ways we want your help.

Please use issues to report bugs and request features, ensuring that when creating an issue that there are no duplicates.

## Pull requests

If you're planning on developing new features for our app (which we want!) please submit a feature request first. This ensures we are on the same page
and will reduce the likelihood of us rejecting your pull request!

## Bug reports

If you find a bug in our app please let us know in the issues tab. Please ensure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue!
We would also greatly appreciate it if you tell us the context around the bug, such as what you were doing just before and it would be even
better if you could give us a step-by-step guide on how to replicate the bug.

## Translations

We want translations! If you are confident in your language abilities please feel free to submit a pull request with the language 
you are translating.
